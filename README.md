# Git_Worktree_Demo
This repo tries to achieve the following:
1. Keep the "master `.git` *folder*" somewhere on the hard drive;
2. Create a "Dropbox" branch for sycning, through, the Dropbox APP
Hopefully, this demo shall work regardless of the operating system.

# Pending
* [ ] Clean up the work flow by providing step-by-step instructions. Pending
    questions include:
    * How to reproduce the same "branching" setting across PCs (Windows or
        Linux)
* [ ] Finish the following tests on both sources:
    * Change through the Dropbox folder, and try pushing somether:
        * [ ] Can I commit and push inside the Dropbox-Git folder?
        * [ ] Can I fetch the branch from afar (the local git repo), and get
            the commits "registered" on the remote Git server?
* [ ] Challange per [`torek`](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1256452/torek)
